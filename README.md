# coastWideMS

The coastwideMS model is a simulation-estimation model that compares the performance of single-stock (coastwide) single-species and hierarchical multispecies models when assessing a complex of species.

## Model details
### Operating model
The operating model that provides the data to the estimation models is a process-error surplus production biomass dynamics model with a logistic recruitment function.

### Single Species Estimation Models


### Multispecies Models
